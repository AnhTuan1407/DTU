Relational databases are designed to store structured data that is typically unchanging or changes at a relatively slow pace. When dealing with data that changes frequently, such as stock prices or movement locations, storing it in a relational database can lead to performance issues and data inconsistencies. This is because relational databases rely on complex data structures and indexing mechanisms to ensure data integrity and consistency. When data changes frequently, these mechanisms can become a bottleneck, slowing down the system and increasing the risk of data inconsistencies.

Data Inconsistency: If two systems have different names for the same data entity, it can result in data inconsistencies. For example, if one system refers to a customer as "Client" and another system uses the term "Customer," it can lead to confusion and incorrect data mapping
